1
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,780
There's an old joke.

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,700
Two elderly women are
at a Catskill mountain resort.

3
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,900
One says, "The food at
this place is really terrible."

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,820
The other says,
"I know, and such small portions."

5
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,740
That's essentially
how I feel about life:

6
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,380
Full of loneliness, misery,
suffering and unhappiness...

7
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,500
and it's all over
much too quickly.

8
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,500
The other important joke for me...

9
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,860
is one usually attributed
to Groucho Marx...

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,660
but it appears originally in Freud's
Wit and lts Relation to the Unconscious.

11
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,860
It goes like this, I'm paraphrasing:

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,100
I never want to belong to any club that
would have someone like me for a member.

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,860
That's the key joke of my adult life
in terms of my relationships with women.

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,980
Lately the strangest things
have been going through my mind...

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,540
because I turned 40, and I guess
I'm going through a life crisis.

16
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,220
I'm not worried about aging.
I'm not one of those characters.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,740
But I'm balding slightly on top. That's
about the worst you can say about me.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,020
I think I'm going to get better
as I get older.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,940
I think I'm going to be
the balding, virile type...

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,660
as opposed to the distinguished gray.

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,660
Unless I'm neither of those two.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,100
Unless I'm one of those guys with saliva
dribbling out of his mouth...

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,640
who wanders into a cafeteria with a
shopping bag, screaming about socialism.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,060
Annie and I broke up, and I still
can't get my mind around that.

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,580
I keep sifting the pieces
of the relationship through my mind...

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,300
examining my life and trying to
figure out where did the screwup come.

27
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,200
A year ago we were in love.

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,280
It's funny. I'm not a morose type.
I'm not a depressive character.

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,900
I was a reasonably happy kid.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,880
I was brought up in Brooklyn
during World War II.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,220
He's been depressed.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,620
- Suddenly he can't do anything.
- Why are you depressed, Alvy?

33
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,540
Tell Dr. Flicker.
It's something he read.

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,540
Something he read, huh?

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,700
- The universe is expanding.
- The universe is expanding?

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,460
The universe is everything,
and if it's expanding...

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,220
someday it will break apart,
and that will be the end of everything.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,500
What is that your business?
He stopped doing his homework!

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,940
- What's the point?
- What's the universe got to do with it?

40
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,220
You're here in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is not expanding!

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,140
It won't be expanding
for billions of years!

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,960
We've got to try and enjoy ourselves
while we're here! Huh?

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,740
My analyst says I exaggerate
my childhood memories...

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,180
but I swear I was brought up
underneath the roller coaster...

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,340
in the Coney Island section
of Brooklyn.

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,540
Maybe that accounts for my personality,
which is a little nervous.

47
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,140
I have a hyperactive imagination.
My mind tends to jump around a little.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,560
I have some trouble
between fantasy and reality.

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,700
My father ran
the bumper-car concession.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,380
There he is, and there I am.

51
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,800
I used to get my aggression out
through those cars.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,420
I remember the staff
at our public school.

53
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,700
We had a saying,
"Those who can't do, teach...

54
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,900
and those who can't teach,
teach gym."

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,200
And those who couldn't do anything,
I think, were assigned to our school.

56
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,420
I must say, I always thought
my schoolmates were idiots.

57
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,300
Melvyn Greenglass
and his fat little face.

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,380
And Henrietta Farrell,
Miss Perfect all the time.

59
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,900
And Ivan Ackerman,
always the wrong answer. Always!

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
Seven and three is nine.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,980
Even then I knew
they were just jerks.

62
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,440
In 1942 I had already discovered women.

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,740
He kissed me!

64
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,180
That's the second time this month!
Step up here.

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,140
- What did I do?
- Step up here.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,700
- What did I do?
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,580
Why? I was just expressing
a healthy sexual curiosity.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,980
Six-year-old boys
don't have girls on their minds.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,180
I did.

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,980
For God sakes, Alvy, even Freud
speaks of a latency period!

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,060
I never had a latency period.
I can't help it.

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,380
Why couldn't you
have been more like Donald?

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,700
There was a model boy.

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,060
Tell the folks
where you are today, Donald.

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,500
I run a profitable dress company.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,140
Sometimes I wonder where
my classmates are today.

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm president
of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

78
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,660
I sell talliths.

79
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,400
I used to be a heroin addict,
now I'm a methadone addict.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm into leather.

81
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,060
I lost track of most of my old
schoolmates, but I wound up a comedian.

82
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,060
They did not take me in the army.

83
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,660
I was 4-P.

84
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,200
In the event of war,
I'm a hostage.

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,980
You always only saw the worst
in people.

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,980
You never could get along
with anyone in school.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,380
You were always out of step
with the world.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,260
Even when you got famous,
you still distrusted the world.

89
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,820
I distinctly heard it.
He muttered under his breath, "Jew."

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,740
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,860
We were walking off the tennis court.
He was there and me and his wife.

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,860
He looked her,
then they both looked at me...

93
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,020
and under his breath
he said, "Jew."

94
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,980
You're a total paranoid.

95
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,820
How am I a paranoid?
I pick up on those kind of things.

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,340
I was having lunch with guys from NBC,
so I said, "Did you eat yet?"

97
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,820
Tom Christie said, "No. Jew?"
Not "Did you?"

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,020
Not "Did you eat?" but "Jew eat?"
You get it?

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,620
- Max...
- Stop calling me Max.

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,260
Why? It's a good name for you.
Max, you see conspiracies in everything.

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,780
No, I don't. I was in a record store.
Listen to this.

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,220
There's this tall, blond crew-cutted guy
and he's looking at me in a funny way.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,060
He's saying, "Yes, we have a sale
this week on Wagner."

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,260
Wagner, Max.
I know what he's trying to tell me.

105
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,740
Very significantly, Wagner.

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,220
Right, Max. California, Max.

107
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,220
- Get the hell out of this crazy city.
- Forget it.

108
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,180
We move to sunny L.A.
All of show business is out there.

109
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,940
You keep bringing it up,
but I don't want to live in a city...

110
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,980
where the only cultural advantage is you
can make a right turn on a red light.

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,940
All right, forget it. Aren't you
going to be late for meeting Annie?

112
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,720
I'm meeting her in front of the Beekman.
I have a few minutes left, right?

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,960
Are you on television?

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,980
Yeah, occasionally.

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,660
What's your name?

116
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,580
You wouldn't know it.
It doesn't matter.

117
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,520
You're on Johnny Carson, right?

118
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,220
Once in a while.

119
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,700
What's your name?

120
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,040
- I'm Robert Redford.
- Come on!

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Alvy Singer.
Thanks very much for everything.

122
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
This is Alvy Singer!

123
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,100
This guy's on television.
Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,420
- Give me a break.
- This guy's on television.

125
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,340
I need the large polo mallet.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,580
- Who's on television?
- This guy, on the Johnny Carson Show.

127
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,100
- Is this a meeting of the teamsters?
- What program?

128
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,060
- Can I have your autograph?
- You don't want my autograph.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,940
I do! It's for my girlfriend.

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,980
Make it out to Ralph.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,520
- Your girlfriend's name is Ralph?
- It's for my brother.

132
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
You're really Alvy Singer,
the TV star?

133
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,060
- Alvy Singer over here!
- It's all right, fellas.

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,740
Jesus, what did you do?
Come by way of the Panama Canal?

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,900
- I'm in a bad mood.
- I'm here with the Godfather cast.

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,940
- Learn to deal with it.
- I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech.

137
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,500
Please, I have a headache.

138
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,500
You are in a bad mood.
You must be getting your period.

139
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm not getting my period! Jesus!

140
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,500
Every time anything out of the ordinary
happens, you think I have my period.

141
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,180
A little louder. I think one
of them may have missed it.

142
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,300
- Has the picture started?
- Two minutes ago.

143
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
That's it. Forget it.
I can't go in.

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,340
- Two minutes.
- We've blown it already.

145
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,700
I can't go in, in the middle.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,580
In the middle? We've only missed
the titles. They're in Swedish.

147
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,500
You want to get coffee for two hours?

148
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,700
- Two hours? No. I'm going in.
- Go ahead. Good-bye.

149
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,380
While we're talking,
we could be inside.

150
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,220
Can we not argue in front of everybody?
I get embarrassed.

151
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,740
- All right. So what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Go to another movie?

152
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,980
- Let's see The Sorrow and the Pity.
- We've seen it.

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,020
I'm not in the mood to see
a four hour documentary on Nazis.

154
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,060
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,860
I've got to see a picture exactly
from start to finish, 'cause I'm anal.

156
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
That's a polite word
for what you are.

157
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,020
We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best.

158
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,060
It lacks a cohesive structure.

159
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,820
You get the feeling he's not absolutely
sure what it is he wants to say.

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,620
I've always felt he was essentially
a technical filmmaker.

161
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,660
Granted La Strada was a great film.

162
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,740
Great in its use of negative imagery
more than anything else.

163
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
- I'm going to have a stroke.
- Stop listening to him.

164
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,220
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

165
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,580
All that Juliet of the Spirits
or Satyricon.

166
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,700
I found it incredibly indulgent.

167
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,820
He really is one of
the most indulgent of filmmakers.

168
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
Key word here is "indulgent."

169
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,180
- What are you depressed about?
- I missed my therapy. I overslept.

170
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,260
How can you possibly oversleep?

171
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,980
The alarm clock.

172
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,980
You know what a hostile gesture
that is to me?

173
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,940
I know. Because of our
sexual problem, right?

174
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,820
Everybody in line has to know
our rate of intercourse?

175
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,620
It's like Samuel Beckett.

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,380
I admire the technique,
but it doesn't hit me on a gut level.

177
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,100
- I'd like to hit him on a gut level.
- Stop it.

178
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,980
He's spitting on my neck
when he talks.

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,100
You know something else?
You're so egocentric that...

180
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,560
if I miss my therapy you can only think
of it in terms of how it affects you!

181
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,860
They're probably on their first date.

182
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,420
Probably met by answering an ad
in the New York Review of Books.

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,340
"Thirtyish academic
wishes to meet woman...

184
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,180
who's interested in Mozart,
James Joyce and sodomy."

185
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,100
What do you mean
"our sexual problem"?

186
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,620
I'm comparatively normal
for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

187
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,580
I'm sorry. My sexual problem.
Okay? My sexual problem!

188
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,620
I never read that. That was Henry James'
sequel to Turn of the Screw?

189
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,140
It's the influence of television.

190
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,740
Marshall McLuhan deals with it
in terms of it being a high intensity.

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,820
Do you understand?
A hot medium.

192
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,940
What I wouldn't give for a large sock
with horse manure in it.

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,660
What do you do when you get stuck
on a movie line with a guy like this?

194
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,700
Wait. Why can't I give my opinion?
It's a free country!

195
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,140
He can.
Do you have to give it so loud?

196
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,540
Aren't you ashamed
to pontificate like that?

197
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,740
The funny part is, you don't know
anything about Marshall McLuhan.

198
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,180
I happen to teach a class at Columbia
called "TV, Media and Culture."

199
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,900
I think my insights into Mr. McLuhan
have a great deal of validity.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,540
Do you? That's funny, because I happen
to have Mr. McLuhan right here.

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,020
Just let me...
Come over here. Tell him.

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,020
I heard what you were saying.

203
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,420
You know nothing of my work.
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.

204
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,620
How you ever got to teach a course
in anything is totally amazing!

205
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,240
If life were only like this.

206
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,500
June 14, 1940.
The German army occupies Paris.

207
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,500
All over the country,
people are desperate for food.

208
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,020
Those guys in the French Resistance
were really brave.

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,780
To have to listen
to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

210
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,540
I know. Sometimes I ask myself
how I'd stand up under torture.

211
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,540
You? You kidding?

212
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,420
The Gestapo would take away your charge
card, and you'd tell 'em everything.

213
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,460
That movie makes me feel guilty.

214
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,600
It's supposed to.

215
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,460
- Alvy, I...
- What?

216
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,760
What's the matter?

217
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,500
It's not natural.
We're sleeping in a bed together.

218
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,420
It's been a long time!

219
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,860
It's just, I mean...

220
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,500
I've got to sing tomorrow night,
so I have to rest my voice.

221
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,700
It's always some kind of an excuse.
You used to think I was very sexy.

222
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,380
When we first started going out,
we had sex constantly.

223
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,980
We're probably listed in
The Guiness Book of World Records.

224
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,740
It'll pass. I'm going
through a phase, that's all.

225
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,220
You've been married before.
You know how things can get.

226
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,920
You were very hot
for Allison at first.

227
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,740
You know that you're on right
after Chris Brown, in about 20 minutes.

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,740
Excuse me.
When do I go on?

229
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,700
Who are you?

230
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,100
Alvy Singer.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,740
- I'm the comedian.
- Oh, comedian.

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh, you're on next.

233
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,620
What do you mean "next"?

234
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,740
You're on right after this act.

235
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,420
- It can't be, because he's a comic.
- Yes.

236
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,780
- You're putting on two comics in a row?
- Why not?

237
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,100
No, I'm sorry. I'm not going to go on
after another comedian.

238
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,340
- It's okay.
- No. They're laughing. I'd rather not.

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,780
Will you relax, please?
They're going to love you.

240
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,780
I know. I prefer not to.
Look, they're laughing at him.

241
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,020
What are you telling me?
They'll laugh at him a few minutes.

242
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,020
Then I've got to get laughs, too.
How much can they laugh?

243
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,740
- They're laughed out.
- Do you feel all right?

244
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,880
Jesus.

245
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,700
- What's your name?
- Allison.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,140
Yeah? Allison what?

247
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Portchnik.

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
- Portchnik? That's nice.
- Thank you.

249
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,860
So, you work for Stevenson
all the time?

250
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,860
- No. I'm doing my thesis.
- On what?

251
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,940
Political commitment
in 20th-century literature.

252
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,260
You're like New York Jewish,
left-wing, intellectual...

253
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,460
Central Park West, Brandeis University,
socialist summer camps...

254
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,540
and the father
with the Ben Shahn drawings...

255
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,620
really strike-oriented...

256
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,940
Stop me before I make
a complete imbecile of myself.

257
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,260
That was wonderful! I love being reduced
to a cultural stereotype.

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,720
Right. I'm a bigot,
but for the left.

259
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,540
I have to go out there.
Say something encouraging, quickly.

260
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,160
- I think you're cute.
- Yeah? Do you?

261
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,360
Go ahead.

262
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,500
I don't know why they would have me
at this kind of rally...

263
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,100
'cause I'm not essentially
a political comedian.

264
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,660
I interestingly had dated a woman...

265
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,700
in the Eisenhower administration,
briefly.

266
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,440
It was ironic to me...

267
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,300
'cause I was trying to do to her...

268
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
what Eisenhower's been doing
to the country for the last eight years.

269
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,380
I'm sorry.
I can't go through with this.

270
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,780
I can't get it off my mind!
It's obsessing me!

271
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm getting tired of it.
I need your attention.

272
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,700
But it doesn't make any sense.
He drove past the book depository...

273
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,900
and the police said conclusively
that it was an exit wound.

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,140
So how is it possible for Oswald
to have fired from two angles at once?

275
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,200
It doesn't make sense!

276
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,740
I'll tell you this.
He was not marksman enough...

277
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,180
to hit a moving target at that range.

278
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,580
But if there was a second assassin...

279
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,100
- That's it!
- We've been through this.

280
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,620
They recovered the shells
from that rifle.

281
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,660
What are you saying now?

282
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,980
That everybody on the Warren Commission
is in on this conspiracy, right?

283
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,660
Why not?

284
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,740
- Earl Warren?
- Honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

285
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,660
Lyndon Johnson?

286
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,020
Lyndon Johnson is a politician!

287
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,500
You know the ethics those guys have.
It's a notch underneath child molester.

288
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,900
Then everybody's in on the conspiracy.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,060
The FBI and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover,
the oil companies...

290
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,340
the Pentagon, the men's-room attendant
at the White House?

291
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,460
I would leave out
the men's-room attendant.

292
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,660
You're using this conspiracy theory
as an excuse to avoid sex with me.

293
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,940
Oh, my God!
She's right.

294
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,100
Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik?

295
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,980
She was beautiful. She was willing.
She was real intelligent.

296
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,780
Is it the old Groucho Marx joke...

297
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,680
that I don't want to belong to any club
that would have me for a member?

298
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,140
- Alvy, don't panic!
- It's a mistake...

299
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,060
to bring a live thing in the house.

300
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,060
Don't do that.

301
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,500
Maybe we should call the police.
Dial 911. It's the lobster squad.

302
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,020
They're only baby ones.
For God sakes.

303
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,100
- If they're babies, you pick them up.
- All right! All right!

304
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,940
- Here you go!
- Don't give it to me.

305
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,140
Look! One crawled
behind the refrigerator.

306
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,920
It'll turn up in our bed at night.
Get out of here with that thing!

307
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,940
Talk to him.
You speak shellfish.

308
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,700
Hey, put it in the pot.

309
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,180
I can't. I can't put a live thing
in hot water.

310
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,420
What d'you think we were going to do,
take him to the movies?

311
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,500
Good. Oh, thank you.

312
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,420
Okay, it's in.
It's definitely in the pot.

313
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,140
Annie, there's a big lobster
behind the refrigerator.

314
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,020
I can't get it out.
This thing's heavy.

315
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,860
Maybe if I put a dish of butter sauce
here, it'll run out the other side.

316
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,780
I'm going to get my camera.

317
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,340
I think if I could pry...

318
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,760
We should have gotten steaks, 'cause
they don't have legs and run around.

319
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,260
- Pick this lobster up. Hold it, please.
- You're going to take pictures now?

320
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,900
Alvy, it'll be wonderful.
Oh, lovely!

321
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,500
- It's disgusting.
- One more, please? One more.

322
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,940
Good!

323
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,360
Here's what I want to know.
Am I your first, big romance?

324
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,660
- Who was?
- There was Dennis from high school.

325
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,340
Local kid who'd meet you in front
of the movie house on Saturday night?

326
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,140
- You should've seen how I looked then.
- I can imagine. An astronaut's wife.

327
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,060
- Then there was Jerry, the actor.
- Look at you.

328
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,980
You're such a clown.

329
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,460
- I look pretty.
- You always do. But that guy with you!

330
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,860
Acting is like an exploration
of the soul. It's very religious.

331
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,300
Like a kind of
liberating consciousness.

332
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,540
It's like a visual poem.

333
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,580
Is he kidding with that crap?

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,900
Oh, right!

335
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,300
Right. I think I know exactly what
you mean when you say "religious."

336
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,980
- You do?
- Come on. I was younger.

337
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,900
That was last year!

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,820
It's like when I think of dying.
You know how I'd like to die?

339
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,260
How?

340
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,300
I'd like to get torn apart
by wild animals.

341
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,980
- Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
- He was a terrific actor.

342
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,220
He's neat looking
and he was emotional.

343
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,460
I don't think you like
emotion too much.

344
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,220
Touch my heart with your foot.

345
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,060
I may throw up.

346
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,540
- He was creepy.
- Yeah!

347
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,740
- You're pretty lucky I came along.
- Oh, really? La-de-dah!

348
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,460
If anyone ever told me
that I'd be taking out a girl...

349
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,540
who used expressions
like "la-de-dah"...

350
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,700
That's right. You really like
those New York girls.

351
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,020
- Not just. Not only.
- I'd say so. You married two of them.

352
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,580
There's Henry Drucker.

353
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,700
He has a Chair in History
at Princeton.

354
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,780
The short man is Hershel Kaminsky.
He has a Chair in Philosophy at Cornell.

355
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,700
Two more chairs,
they got a dining room set.

356
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,060
- Why are you so hostile?
- I want to watch the Knicks on TV.

357
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,300
Is that Paul Goodman? No.

358
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,340
Be nice to the host,
because he's publishing my book.

359
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,420
Hi, Doug.
Douglas Wyeth...

360
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,060
The Foul Rag-and-Bone Shop
of the Heart.

361
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,740
I'm so tired
of spending evenings...

362
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,740
making fake insights
with people who work for Dysentery.

363
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,180
Commentary.

364
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,100
I heard Commentary and Dissent
had merged and formed Dysentery.

365
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,100
No jokes.
These are friends. Okay?

366
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,500
Cleveland Cavaliers losing
to the New York Knicks.

367
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,580
Here you are.
There's people out there.

368
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,340
Two minutes ago,
the Knicks are ahead 14 points...

369
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,840
and now they're ahead two points.

370
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,580
Alvy, what is so fascinating...

371
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,340
about a group of pituitary cases
trying to stuff a ball through a hoop?

372
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,420
What is fascinating
is that it's physical.

373
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,340
That's one thing about intellectuals:

374
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,900
They've proved you can be brilliant
and have no idea what's going on.

375
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,640
But, on the other hand,
the body doesn't lie as we now know.

376
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,380
Stop acting out.

377
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,460
It'll be great, because all those
Ph.Ds. are in there discussing...

378
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,260
modes of alienation,
and we'll be in here quietly humping.

379
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't. You're using sex
to express hostility.

380
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,380
"Why do you always reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories,"...

381
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,400
he said as he removed her brassier.

382
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,180
There are people out there
from the New Yorker magazine!

383
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,200
My God!
What would they think?

384
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,500
- Damn siren!
- Don't get upset.

385
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,340
Damn it! I was so close!

386
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,020
Last night it was a guy
honking his car horn.

387
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,940
The city can't close down.

388
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,380
You want them to close the airport
so we can have sex?

389
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm too tense.
I need a Valium.

390
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,980
My analyst says I should live
in the country and not in New York.

391
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,420
We can't have this discussion all
the time. The country makes me nervous.

392
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,220
You've got crickets. It's quiet.
There's no place to walk after dinner.

393
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,180
There's the screens
with the dead moths behind them.

394
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,100
You got the Manson family, possibly.
You got Dick and Perry.

395
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,980
Okay! My analyst just thinks I'm too
tense! Where's the goddamn Valium?

396
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,340
Okay, it's quiet now.
We can get started again.

397
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,060
I can't! My head is throbbing.

398
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,180
- You got a headache?
- I have a headache!

399
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,980
- Bad?
- Like Oswald in Ghosts.

400
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,380
- Jesus.
- Where are you going?

401
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm going to take another in a series
of cold showers.

402
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,020
Max, my serve is going to send you
to the showers early.

403
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,020
Right. To get back to what
we were discussing.

404
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,380
The failure of the country to get behind
New York City is anti-Semitism.

405
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,260
Max, the city is terribly run.

406
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,580
I'm not discussing politics
or economics. This is foreskin.

407
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,540
That's a convenient out. When some group
disagrees with you, it's anti-Semitism.

408
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,060
The rest of the country
looks upon New York...

409
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,860
like we're left-wing, communist, Jewish,
homosexual pornographers.

410
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,420
I think of us that way sometimes,
and I live here.

411
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,860
Max, if we lived in California, we could
play outdoors every day in the sun.

412
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,940
Sun is bad for you. Everything
our parents said was good is bad.

413
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,520
Sun, milk, red meat, college.

414
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,080
Egad, here he comes.

415
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,860
You know Alvy?
This is Janet.

416
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,380
- This is Annie Hall.
- This is Alvy.

417
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,900
- Who's playing with who here?
- You and me against them?

418
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,980
- That's not fair.
- I can't play too good.

419
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,480
I've had four lessons.

420
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,420
Well...

421
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,920
bye.

422
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,420
- You play very well.
- Oh, yeah? So do you!

423
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,420
God, what a dumb thing to say.

424
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,140
You say "You play well," and right away
I have to say, "You play well."

425
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,300
Oh, God, Annie.

426
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,380
Well. Oh, well!

427
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,800
La-de-dah.

428
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,580
You want a lift?

429
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,980
Oh, why?
You got a car?

430
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,740
No, I was going to take a cab.

431
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,240
Oh, no. I have a car.

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
You have a car?

433
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,900
If you have a car...

434
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,320
then why did you say, "Do you have
a car" like you wanted a lift?

435
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,200
Geez, I don't know.
I wasn't...

436
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,060
I got this VW out there.

437
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,640
What a jerk.

438
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,460
Would you like a lift?

439
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,540
- Sure. Which way are you going?
- Me? Oh, downtown.

440
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,460
I'm going uptown.

441
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,860
Oh, I'm going uptown, too.

442
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,420
- You said you were going downtown.
- Yeah, well...

443
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,820
I can go uptown, too.
I live uptown.

444
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,680
What the hell? It would be nice
having company. I hate driving alone.

445
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,980
How long do you know Janet?
Where do you know her from?

446
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,540
- I'm in her acting class.
- You're an actress!

447
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,740
Well, I do commercials, sort of.

448
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,100
You want to watch the road?
You're not from New York, right?

449
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,020
- Chippewa Falls.
- Right.

450
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,100
- Where?
- Wisconsin.

451
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,760
- You're driving a tad rapidly.
- Don't worry. I'm a very good driver.

452
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,900
- You want some gum?
- No, thanks.

453
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,300
- Where is it?
- Don't do that. No, no, watch the road.

454
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,140
I'll get it.
Concentrate, will ya?

455
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,900
- I'll get you a piece.
- Listen. You drive?

456
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,940
Do I drive?
No, I got a problem with driving.

457
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,980
- You do?
- Yeah.

458
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,000
I got a license,
but I have too much hostility.

459
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,420
Nice car.
You keep it nice.

460
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,000
- Can I ask you, is this a sandwich?
- Oh, yeah.

461
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,680
I live over here. Oh, my God, look!
There's a parking space.

462
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,520
That's okay,
we can walk to the curb from here.

463
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,180
You want your tennis stuff?
You want your gear?

464
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,020
Yeah. That's good. Thanks.
Thanks a lot. Well.

465
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,520
Well.

466
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

467
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,980
You're a wonderful tennis player...

468
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,460
and you're the worst driver
I've ever seen in my life.

469
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,140
Anyplace. Europe. Anyplace. Asia.

470
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,500
- I love what you're wearing.
- You do? Yeah.

471
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,740
This tie is a present from Grammy Hall.

472
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,220
Who? Grammy Hall?

473
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,900
Yeah, my grammy.

474
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,020
What did you do, grow up in a
Norman Rockwell painting? Your grammy?

475
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,180
- It's pretty silly, isn't it?
- My grammy never gave gifts.

476
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,060
She was too busy getting raped
by Cossacks.

477
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,300
Well, thank you again.

478
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,860
Oh, yeah.

479
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,620
Listen. You want to come upstairs
and have a glass of wine or something?

480
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,020
No, I mean you don't have to.
You're probably late and everything.

481
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,340
No, that would be fine.
I wouldn't mind. Sure.

482
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,820
I got time. I got nothing
until my analyst appointment.

483
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,900
You see an analyst?

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,540
- Just for 15 years.
- 15 years?

485
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,020
I'm going to give him one more year,
and then I'm going to Lourdes.

486
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,000
15? Nah, come on! Yeah? Really?

487
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,380
Sylvia Plath. Interesting poetess
whose tragic suicide...

488
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,120
was misinterpreted as romantic
by the college-girl mentality.

489
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,580
Right. I don't know.
I mean, some of her poems seem neat.

490
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,860
Neat? I hate to tell you this is 1975.

491
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,220
"Neat" went out
at the turn of the century.

492
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,500
Who are those photos on the wall?

493
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,140
Oh, you see...

494
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,140
that's my dad, that's Father,
and that's my brother, Duane.

495
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,980
Yeah, right.
And over there's Grammy Hall.

496
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,860
- And that's Sadie.
- Who's Sadie?

497
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,420
Well, Sadie met Grammy
through Grammy's brother, George.

498
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,700
George was real sweet.
He had that thing.

499
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,980
What is that thing where you fall asleep
in the middle of a sentence?

500
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,900
- Narcolepsy.
- Right.

501
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,580
So anyway, George went to the union
to get his free turkey...

502
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,180
because the union always gave George
this free turkey at Christmastime...

503
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,620
because he was shell-shocked
in the first World War.

504
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,540
Anyway, so George is standing in line...

505
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,900
getting his free turkey...

506
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,820
but the thing is he falls asleep,
and he never wakes up.

507
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,500
So he's dead.

508
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,740
He's dead. Yeah.

509
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,300
Oh, dear.

510
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,020
Well, terrible, huh?
Wouldn't you say?

511
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,740
Pretty awful.

512
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,020
It's a great story, though.
It really made my day.

513
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,060
I think I should get out of here,
'cause I think I'm imposing.

514
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,100
Really? Maybe...

515
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,300
- You don't have to.
- But I'm all perspired and everything.

516
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,860
Didn't you take a shower at the club?

517
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,380
No, no. I never shower
in a public place.

518
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,820
Why not?

519
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,860
I don't like to get naked in front
of another man.

520
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,300
I see.

521
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,700
I don't like to show my body
to a man of my gender.

522
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,300
- I see, I guess.
- You never know what's going to happen.

523
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,600
- 15 years, huh?
- 15 years, yeah.

524
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
God bless.

525
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,080
Well! Well...

526
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,080
You're what Grammy Hall
would call "a real Jew."

527
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
Thank you.

528
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,220
She hates Jews.
She thinks they just make money.

529
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,280
But she's the one, is she ever.
I'm telling you.

530
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,520
So, did you do
those photographs in there?

531
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,520
Yeah, I sort of dabble around, you know.

532
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,980
They're wonderful. They have a quality.

533
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,100
Well, I would like to take
a serious photography course.

534
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,660
Photography's interesting because...

535
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,180
It's a new art form. A set of aesthetic
criteria have not emerged yet.

536
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,120
Aesthetic criteria? You mean whether
it's a good photo or not?

537
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,820
The medium enters in as
a condition of the art form itself.

538
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,260
Well, to me... I mean...
It's all instinctive.

539
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,200
I just try to feel it, to get a sense
of it and not think about it so much.

540
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,480
Still, you need aesthetic guidelines
to put it in social perspective.

541
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,100
I don't know. I mean,
I guess you must be sort of late.

542
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,660
You know, I've got to get there
and begin whining soon.

543
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,660
Are you busy Friday night?

544
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,780
Me? Oh, no.

545
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,960
Oh, I'm sorry, I have something.
What about Saturday night?

546
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,900
Nothing. No, no.

547
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,060
You're very popular, I can see.

548
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,980
- I know.
- You have plague?

549
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,460
I meet a lot of jerks.

550
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,460
I meet a lot of jerks, too.

551
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,540
I'm thinking about
getting some cats.

552
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,180
Wait a second! No, no!
Oh, shoot!

553
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,540
Saturday night, I'm going to sing.

554
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,980
You're going to sing? You sing?
No kidding!

555
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,940
- This is my first time.
- Really? Where?

556
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,180
I'd like to come.

557
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,860
- I'm interested.
- No, no. I'm just a...

558
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,780
I'm auditioning at this club.
It's my first time.

559
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,220
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly
what that's like.

560
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,040
You're going to like nightclubs.
They're really a lot of fun.

561
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,840
It had to be you

562
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:20,240
It had to be you

563
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,380
I wandered around
And finally found

564
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,720
This somebody who

565
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,060
Could make me be true

566
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,080
Could make me be blue

567
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,940
And even be glad

568
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,480
Just to be sad

569
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,360
Thinking of you

570
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,620
I was awful! I'm so ashamed!
I can't sing.

571
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,700
So the audience was a tad restless.

572
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,580
What do you mean, "a tad restless"?
My God, they hated me!

573
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,980
No, they didn't.
You have a wonderful voice.

574
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,940
- I'm going to quit.
- I'm not going to let you.

575
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,420
- You have a great voice.
- Do you think so, really?

576
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,900
- Yeah! It's terrific.
- I never even took a lesson either.

577
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,300
- Listen, give me a kiss.
- Really?

578
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,900
Why not? Because we're just going
to go home later.

579
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,380
There's going to be all that tension.
We've never kissed before.

580
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,460
I'll never know when
to make the right move.

581
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,180
We'll kiss now and get it over with,
and then we'll go eat. Okay?

582
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,520
We'll digest our food better.

583
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,280
Okay? Now we can digest our food.

584
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,460
Corned beef, please.

585
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,540
I'm having pastrami on white bread...

586
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,480
with mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce.

587
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,060
So, your second wife left you.

588
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,700
Were you depressed about that?

589
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,260
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins
couldn't cure.

590
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,020
- Your first wife, Allison.
- She was nice.

591
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,520
That was my fault.
I was too crazy.

592
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,740
That was so nice!
That was nice.

593
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,560
As Balzac said,
"There goes another novel."

594
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,260
You were great.

595
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,780
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

596
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,820
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- You're wrecked.

597
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,260
I mean it.
I'll never play the piano again.

598
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,340
It was, I don't know.
You really thought it was good?

599
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,620
Good? Yes. No, that was the most fun
I've had without laughing.

600
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,500
Here, you want some?

601
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,820
No, I don't use
any major hallucinogenics.

602
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,180
I took a puff about five years ago
at a party...

603
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,080
and tried to take my pants off
over my head.

604
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,640
I don't do it very often.
It just sort of relaxes me.

605
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,800
- You won't believe this, but...
- What?

606
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,820
I'm going to buy you these books...

607
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,060
because I think you should read them
instead of that cat book.

608
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,780
That's pretty serious stuff.

609
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,180
I'm obsessed with death, I think.

610
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,140
It's a big subject with me.
I have a pessimistic view of life.

611
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,500
You should know this about me
if we're going to go out.

612
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,620
I feel that life is divided up
into the horrible and the miserable.

613
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,620
Those are the two categories.

614
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,260
The horrible would be like terminal
cases and blind people, cripples.

615
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,660
I don't know how they get through life.
It's amazing to me.

616
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,420
And the miserable is everyone else.

617
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,820
So when you go through life,
be thankful that you're miserable.

618
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,520
You're very lucky to be miserable.

619
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,620
Look at that guy.
There's Mr. Miami Beach in the pink.

620
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,340
He's just come back
from the gin rummy finals.

621
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,180
He placed third.

622
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,140
Look at these guys. That's hilarious.
They're back from Fire Island.

623
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,980
They're sort of giving it
a chance romantically.

624
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,820
- Italian, right?
- Him? He's the Mafia.

625
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,060
Linen supply business
or cement and contracting.

626
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,580
Oh, gee,
mess up my moustache wax.

627
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,380
There's the winner of the Truman Capote
look-alike contest.

628
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,020
You are unbelievably sexy.
Yes, you are.

629
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,780
You know what you are?
You're polymorphously perverse.

630
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,300
What does that mean?
I don't know what that is.

631
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,180
You're exceptional in bed...

632
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,100
because you get pleasure in every part
of your body when I touch it.

633
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,860
Like the tip of your nose, and if
I stroke your teeth or your knee caps...

634
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,020
you certainly get excited.

635
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,220
You know what?
I like you, I really do.

636
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,100
But do you love me?
That's the key question.

637
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,420
I know you've only known me
a short while.

638
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,300
I think that's sort of...
Yeah, yeah.

639
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,220
Do you love me?

640
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,500
Love is too weak a word for what...
I "lurve" you.

641
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,700
I "loave" you.
I "luff" you, with two "f"s.

642
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,860
Of course I do.
Don't you think I do?

643
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,960
I don't know.

644
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,460
What do you mean? You're not going
to give up your own apartment, are you?

645
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,380
- Of course.
- But why?

646
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,620
I'm moving in with you, that's why.

647
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,660
- But you have a nice apartment.
- I have a tiny apartment.

648
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,620
- I know it's small.
- And it's got bad plumbing and bugs.

649
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,380
Granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs.
You say that like it's a negative.

650
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,580
Bugs are...

651
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,340
- Entomology is a rapidly growing field.
- You don't want me to live with you.

652
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,220
- I don't? Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

653
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,500
It was yours, actually.

654
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,820
But I approved it immediately.

655
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,740
You think I talked you
into something.

656
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,180
No. We live together,
we sleep together, we eat together.

657
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,460
Jesus, you don't want it to be
like we're married, do you?

658
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,340
- How is it any different?
- Because you keep your own apartment.

659
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,820
It's there. We don't have to go to it,
deal with it...

660
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,780
but it's like a free-floating life raft
that we know that we're not married.

661
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,260
That little apartment
is $400 a month, Alvy.

662
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,340
- That place is $400 a month?
- Yes, it is.

663
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,380
It's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Jesus.

664
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,260
My accountant will write it off
as a tax deduction. I'll pay for it.

665
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,860
You don't think I'm smart enough
to be serious about.

666
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,540
Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,700
Then why are you always pushing me
to take college courses like I was dumb?

668
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,820
Adult education is a wonderful thing!

669
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,080
You meet a lot of interesting
professors. It's stimulating.

670
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,280
Does this sound like a good course:
"Modern American Poetry"?

671
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,180
Or, let's see...

672
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,180
maybe I should take
"Introduction to the Novel."

673
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,740
Just don't take any course
where they make you read Beowulf.

674
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,820
What?

675
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,100
What do you think? Should we go
to that party in South Hampton?

676
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,500
No, don't be silly.
What do we need other people for?

677
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,220
We should just turn out the lights
and play hide the "salam" or something.

678
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,140
Well, I'm going to get a cigarette,
okay?

679
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,220
Grass, right? The illusion that it makes
a white woman more like Billie Holiday.

680
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,340
- Have you ever made love high?
- Me? No.

681
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,900
If I have grass or alcohol,
I get unbearably wonderful.

682
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,860
I get too wonderful for words.

683
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,700
I don't know why you have to get high
every time we make love.

684
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,540
It relaxes me.

685
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,060
You have to be artificially relaxed
before we can go to bed?

686
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,220
What's the difference, anyway?

687
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,820
I'll give you a shot of Sodium
Pentothal. You can sleep through it.

688
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,100
Look who's talking! You've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

689
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,580
You should smoke some of this.
You'd be off the couch in no time.

690
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,820
- Come on, you don't need that.
- What are you doing?

691
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,440
- No, Alvy, please?
- You can live without it once.

692
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Wait, I got a great idea.

693
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,020
Hang in there for a second.
I got a little erotic artifact...

694
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,020
that I brought up from the city,
which I think is going to be perfect.

695
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,780
There. Create a little
old New Orleans essence.

696
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,900
Now we can go about our business...

697
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,800
and even develop photographs
if we want to.

698
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,300
- Is something wrong?
- No, why?

699
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,180
I don't know.
It's like you're removed.

700
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,100
No, I'm fine.

701
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,100
Really?

702
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,700
I don't know.
You seem sort of distant.

703
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,740
Let's just do it, all right?

704
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,160
Was it my imagination or are you
just going through the motions?

705
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,420
Alvy, do you remember
where I put my drawing pad?

706
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,300
Because while you two are doing that,
I'm going to do some drawing.

707
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,540
That's what I call removed!

708
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,500
You have my body.

709
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,780
But I want the whole thing!

710
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,700
I need grass.

711
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,580
It ruins it for me if you have grass.

712
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,820
I'm like a comedian, so if I get a laugh
from a person who's high...

713
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,620
it doesn't count,
'cause they're always laughing.

714
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,540
Were you always funny?

715
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,200
Is this an interview?
We're supposed to be making love.

716
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,460
This guy is naturally funny.
I think he can write for you.

717
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,260
Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid,
he tells me you're really good.

718
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,660
Let me explain how I work.
You can tell off the bat...

719
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,500
that I don't look like a funny guy
like some of the guys.

720
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,820
You know they're going to tell you their
stories, you're going to fall down.

721
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,540
But I gotta be really talented.
Material's got to be sensational for me.

722
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,380
I work... I'm kind of classy.
Know what I mean?

723
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,700
Let me explain.
I'll open with an opening song.

724
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,660
The music will start.

725
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,420
I walk out.
Place looks wonderful from here

726
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,100
You folks look wonderful from here

727
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,660
And seeing you there
With a smile on your face

728
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,020
Makes me shout
This must be the place

729
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,060
I stop, and then I open with some jokes.
That's where I need you.

730
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,700
I'll say, "I just got back from Canada.
They speak a lot of French.

731
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,620
The only word to know is 'John Dark'. It
means the light's out in the bathroom.

732
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,860
- I met a big lumberjack.
- Jesus, this guy's pathetic.

733
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,460
Look at him mincing around.
Boy, thinks he's real cute.

734
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,700
You want to throw up.

735
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,680
If only I had the nerve
to do my own jokes.

736
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,460
I don't know how much longer I can keep
this smile frozen on my face.

737
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,420
I'm in the wrong business.
I know it.

738
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,220
"But, cherie...

739
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,860
what will I do with this, eh?"

740
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,740
He says, "Oh, Marie,
sometime you make me so mad!"

741
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,780
They scream at that.
Write me something like that, will you?

742
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,440
Kind of a French number.
Can you do it?

743
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,420
Where am I?
I have to reorient myself.

744
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,380
This is the University
of Wisconsin, right?

745
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,940
Because I'm always tense
when I'm playing a college.

746
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,340
I have a bad history with colleges.
I went to New York University.

747
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,220
And I was thrown out of NYU
my freshman year...

748
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,460
for cheating on my metaphysics final.

749
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,660
I looked within the soul
of the boy sitting next to me.

750
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,780
My mother, an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom...

751
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,840
and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tiles.

752
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,580
I was depressed at that time.
I was in analysis.

753
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,300
I was suicidal, as a matter of fact,
and would have killed myself...

754
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,940
but I was in analysis
with a strict Freudian.

755
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,520
And if you kill yourself, they make you
pay for the sessions you miss.

756
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,140
Alvy, you were just great.
I'm not kidding.

757
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,860
College audiences are wonderful.

758
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,940
You know what? I think I'm starting
to get more of the references, too.

759
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,980
Are you? The 12:00 show
is completely different than the 9:00.

760
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It'll
be nice. You'll meet Mother and Father.

761
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,720
They'll hate me immediately.

762
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,080
No, I don't think they're going
to hate you at all. Contrary.

763
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,600
It's Easter. We'll sit down and eat.
I think they'll really like you.

764
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,040
It's a nice ham this year, Mom.

765
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,060
Grammy always does such a good job.

766
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,820
Great sauce.

767
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,320
It is.
It's dynamite ham.

768
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,860
We went to the swap meet.

769
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,420
Annie, Gram and I.
Got some nice picture frames.

770
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,680
We really had a good time.

771
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,160
Ann tells us you've been seeing
a psychiatrist for 15 years.

772
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,020
Yes. I'm making excellent progress.

773
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,320
Soon, when I lie down on his couch,
I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

774
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,980
- Duane and I went to the boat basin.
- We caulked hulls all day.

775
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,900
And Randolph Hunt was drunk as usual.

776
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,340
That Randolph Hunt!
You remember Randy Hunt, Annie.

777
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,060
- He was in the choir with you.
- Oh, yes.

778
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,540
I can't believe this family.

779
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,340
Annie's mother is really beautiful.

780
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,980
And they're talking swap meets
and boat basins.

781
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,620
The old lady at the end of the table
is a classic Jew-hater.

782
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,140
They really look American, healthy,
like they never get sick or anything.

783
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,280
Nothing like my family.
The two are like oil and water.

784
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,380
Ah, let him drop dead.
Who needs his business?

785
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,860
- His wife has diabetes.
- Diabetes? Is that an excuse?

786
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,140
The man is 50 years old
and doesn't have a substantial job.

787
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,900
Is that a reason to steal
from your partner?

788
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,300
You don't know what
you're talking about.

789
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,980
Defend him!

790
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,540
Pass the brisket.

791
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,060
Mo Moskowitz.
He had a coronary.

792
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,000
You don't say!

793
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,060
How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs. Singer?

794
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,140
- We fast.
- Fast?

795
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,340
No food.
You know, to atone for our sins.

796
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,420
What sins?
I don't understand.

797
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,280
Neither do we.

798
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,900
Hi, Duane. How's it going?

799
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,820
- This is my room.
- Oh, yeah? It's terrific.

800
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,840
Can I confess something?

801
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,240
I tell you this, because, as an artist,
I think you'll understand.

802
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,940
Sometimes when I'm driving...

803
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,900
on the road at night...

804
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,260
I see two headlights
coming toward me, fast.

805
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,660
I have this impulse
to turn the wheel quickly...

806
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,920
head-on into the oncoming car.

807
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,100
I can anticipate the explosion.

808
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,140
The sound of shattering glass.

809
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,480
The flames rising out
of the flowing gasoline.

810
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,440
Right.

811
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,220
I have to go now, Duane, because
I'm due back on the planet Earth.

812
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,140
Don't let it be so long now.

813
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,700
- Look up Uncle Billy, promise.
- He is adorable.

814
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,140
- You'll take them to the airport now?
- No. Duane can.

815
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,880
- I haven't finished my drink.
- Yes, Duane is. I'll be right...

816
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,940
You followed me.
I can't believe it!

817
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,900
- I didn't follow you.
- You followed me!

818
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,340
Because I was walking a block behind
staring at you? That's not following.

819
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,940
- What's your definition of "following"?
- Following is different. I was spying.

820
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,580
Do you realize
how paranoid you are?

821
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,900
Paranoid? I'm looking at you, and you've
got your arms around another guy.

822
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,420
That is the worst kind of paranoid!

823
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,700
I didn't start out spying. I thought I'd
surprise you, pick you up after school.

824
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,500
You wanted to keep the relationship
flexible, remember? It's your phrase.

825
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,540
You're having an affair
with your college professor!

826
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,100
That jerk that teaches that crap course,
"Contemporary Crisis in Western Man."

827
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,820
"Existential Motifs in Russian
Literature". You're really close.

828
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,060
What's the difference?
It's all mental masturbation.

829
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,620
Now we're getting to a subject
you know something about.

830
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,540
Don't knock masturbation.
It's sex with someone I love.

831
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,140
We're not having an affair. He's
married. He happens to think I'm neat.

832
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,180
Are you 12 years old? That's one
of your Chippewa Falls expressions.

833
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,940
Who cares?

834
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,540
Next he'll find you're keen and peachy.
Then he'll have his hand on your ass.

835
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,500
You've had hostility towards David
ever since I mentioned him.

836
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,660
- You call your teacher David?
- It's his name.

837
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,180
It's a Biblical name, right?
Does he call you Bathsheba?

838
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,260
Alvy, you're the one who never wanted
to make a real commitment.

839
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,260
You don't think I'm smart enough.
We had that argument last month...

840
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,960
or don't you remember that day?

841
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,980
- I'm home!
- How'd it go?

842
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,900
It was really weird,
but she's a very nice woman.

843
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,460
I didn't have to lie on the couch.
She had me sitting up.

844
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,260
I told her about the family
and my feelings towards men...

845
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,420
and my relationship with my brother.

846
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,100
Then she mentioned penis envy.
Do you know about that?

847
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,300
I'm one of the few males
who suffers from that. Go on.

848
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,700
She said I was guilty about my impulses
towards marriage and children.

849
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,180
Then, I remembered, when I was a kid, I
accidentally saw my parents making love.

850
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,700
All this happened the first hour?
That's amazing.

851
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,260
I've been going for 15 years.
I don't have nothing like that.

852
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,500
I told her my dream,
and then I cried.

853
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,940
You cried. I've never once cried.
That's fantastic to me.

854
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,100
I whine.
I sit and I whine.

855
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,860
In my dream, Frank Sinatra is holding
this pillow across my face...

856
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,780
and I can't breathe.

857
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,980
He's strangling me.

858
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,820
Sure, because he's a singer,
and you're a singer. It's perfect.

859
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,740
You're trying to suffocate yourself.
It makes perfect sense.

860
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,060
That's a perfect analytic insight.

861
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,580
She said your name was Alvy Singer.

862
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,540
- What do you mean, me?
- Yeah, you.

863
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,700
Because in the dream,
I break Sinatra's glasses.

864
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,260
You never said Sinatra had glasses.
Are you saying I'm suffocating you?

865
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,500
God, I did this really terrible thing
to him...

866
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,020
because then when he sang,
it was in this real high-pitch voice.

867
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,620
- What'd the doctor say?
- I should come five times a week.

868
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,780
I don't think I mind analysis at all.
The question is, will it change my wife?

869
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,420
- Will it change your wife?
- Will it change my life?

870
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,780
- But you said "wife".
- No, I said "life".

871
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,820
- No, you said "wife".
- "Life!" I said "life".

872
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,500
She said "wife". You heard that,
because you were there. I'm not crazy.

873
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,300
Then I told her I didn't think
you'd ever take me seriously...

874
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,700
because you don't think
I'm smart enough.

875
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,780
Why do you bring that up? Because I
encourage you to take adult education?

876
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,320
It's a wonderful thing. You meet
wonderful, interesting professors.

877
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,180
Adult education is junk. The professors
are phony. How can you do it?

878
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,020
I don't care what you say about David.
He's a fine teacher.

879
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,660
And why are you following me around?
We should call this relationship quits.

880
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,700
That's fine. That's great.
I don't know what I did wrong.

881
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,420
Somewhere she cooled off to me.
Is it something that I did?

882
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,820
It's never something you do.
That's how people are. Love fades.

883
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,740
Love fades.
God, that's a depressing thought.

884
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,980
I have to ask you a question.
Don't go any further.

885
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,380
With your wife, in bed, does she need
some kind of artificial stimulation...

886
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,540
like marijuana?

887
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,140
We use a large vibrating egg.

888
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,980
A large vibrating egg.

889
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,940
I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of answer. Jesus!

890
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,900
You look like a very happy couple.

891
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,100
- Are you?
- Yeah.

892
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,540
How do you account for it?

893
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,380
I'm very shallow and empty,
and I have no ideas...

894
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,580
and nothing interesting to say.

895
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,820
- I'm exactly the same way.
- I see.

896
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,780
That's interesting. So you've
managed to work out something?

897
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,220
Right.

898
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,940
Thanks for talking to me.

899
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,820
Even as a kid, I went for the wrong
women. I think that's my problem.

900
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,980
When my mother took me
to see Snow White...

901
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,360
everyone fell in love with Snow White,
and I fell for the wicked queen.

902
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,580
- We never have any fun anymore.
- How can you say that?

903
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,100
Why not? You're always
leaning on me to improve myself.

904
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,420
You're upset. You must be
getting your period.

905
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,980
I don't get a period. I'm a cartoon
character. Can't I be upset sometimes?

906
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,820
Max, forget about Annie.
I know lots of women you can date.

907
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,780
I don't want to go out
with other women.

908
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,340
Max, I've got a girl for you.
You are going to love her.

909
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,180
She's a reporter for Rolling Stone.

910
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,180
There are more people here
to see the Maharishi...

911
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,820
than there were
to see the Dylan concert.

912
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,940
I covered the Dylan concert,
which gave me chills.

913
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,140
Especially when he sang,
"She takes just like a woman...

914
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,020
and she makes love
just like a woman.

915
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,940
Yes, she does.

916
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,180
And she aches just like a woman...

917
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,420
but she breaks
just like a little girl."

918
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,340
Up to that, the most
charismatic event I covered...

919
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,940
was Mick's birthday when the Stones
played Madison Square Garden.

920
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,540
That's just great.

921
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,700
You catch Dylan?

922
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,940
No, I couldn't make it.
My raccoon had hepatitis.

923
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,860
You have a raccoon?

924
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,300
A few.

925
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,140
The only word for this
is "transplendent".

926
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,820
- It's transplendent.
- I can think of another word.

927
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,420
He's God.
I mean, this man is God.

928
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,100
He's got millions of followers,
who would crawl across the world...

929
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,060
just to touch
the hem of his garment.

930
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,980
It must be a tremendous hem.

931
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,780
- I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
- Are you?

932
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,900
I can't get with any religion that
advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look.

933
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,140
There's God coming out
of the men's room.

934
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,860
It's unbelievably transplendent!

935
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,020
I was at the Stones' concert
when they killed that guy. Remember?

936
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,020
Were you?
I was at an Alice Cooper thing...

937
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,200
where six people were rushed
to the hospital with bad vibes.

938
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,500
I hope you don't mind
that I took so long to finish.

939
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Me? No. Don't be silly.

940
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,960
I'm starting to get some feeling
back in my jaw now.

941
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,360
Sex with you is really
a Kafkaesque experience.

942
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,340
Thank you.

943
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,780
I mean that as a compliment.

944
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,060
I think there's too much burden
placed on the orgasm...

945
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,360
to make up for empty areas
in life.

946
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,960
Who said that?

947
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,320
I don't know. I think
it may have been Leopold and Loeb.

948
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,520
Hello.

949
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,480
No. What's the matter?

950
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,540
You sound terrible.

951
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,860
No, what... Sure, I...

952
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,100
What kind of emergency?

953
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,780
No, stay there.
I'll come over right now.

954
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,120
Just stay there.
I'll come right over.

955
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,500
It's me. Open up.
Are you okay?

956
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,060
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

957
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,380
There's a spider in the bathroom.

958
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,080
- What?
- There's a big spider in the bathroom.

959
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,500
You got me here at 3:00 a.m.
'Cause a spider's in the bathroom?

960
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,820
You know how I am about insects. I can't
sleep with that thing crawling around.

961
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,300
Kill it!
What's wrong with you?

962
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,300
Don't you have Raid in the house?

963
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:00,060
I told you a thousand times
to keep a lot of insect spray.

964
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,380
- You never know who will crawl over.
- I know.

965
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,500
And a first aid kit
and fire extinguisher.

966
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,940
Give me a magazine,
'cause I'm a little tired.

967
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,100
You make fun of me,
but I'm prepared for anything.

968
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,800
An emergency, a tidal wave,
an earthquake.

969
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,940
What is this?
Did you go to a rock concert?

970
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,380
Yeah.

971
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,980
Really?
How'd you like it?

972
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,060
Was it heavy? Did it achieve
total "heavyosity"?

973
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,420
It was just great!

974
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,740
I've got an idea. Call the guy
who took you to the rock concert...

975
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,140
and he can come and kill the spider.

976
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,700
I called you.
You want to help me or not?

977
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,380
Since when do you read the National
Review? What are you turning into?

978
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,500
I like to get all points of view.

979
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,220
Wonderful. Get William F. Buckley
to kill the spider.

980
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,180
You're a little hostile,
you know that?

981
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,060
Not only that,
you look thin and tired.

982
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,300
It's 3:00 in the morning.
You got me out of bed.

983
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,340
I ran over. I couldn't get a taxi.
You said it was an emergency.

984
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,380
I ran up the stairs.

985
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,660
I was more attractive
when the evening began.

986
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,580
Are you going with
a right-wing rock-and-roll star?

987
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,340
Would you like
a glass of chocolate milk?

988
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,980
- What am I, your son? I came over for...
- I've got the good chocolate.

989
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,860
- Where's the spider?
- It's in the bathroom.

990
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,780
Don't squish it. After it's dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay?

991
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,160
I've been killing spiders
since I was 30. Okay?

992
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,060
It's a very big spider.
A lot of trouble. There's two of 'em.

993
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,460
I didn't think it was that big,
but it's a major spider.

994
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,020
- You got a broom or snow shovel?
- I left it at your house. I'm sorry.

995
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,940
What are you doing?

996
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,520
There's a spider in your bathroom
the size of a Buick.

997
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,940
- You got black soap?
- It's for my complexion.

998
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,040
Are you joining a minstrel show?

999
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,800
Don't worry.

1000
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,260
I did it. I killed them both.
What's the matter?

1001
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,620
What are you sad about? Did you want me
to capture and rehabilitate 'em?

1002
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,700
- Don't go, please.
- What do you mean?

1003
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,980
What's the matter?
Are you expecting termites?

1004
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,220
What's the matter?

1005
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,860
I don't know. I miss you.

1006
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,640
Jesus! Really?

1007
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,400
- Alvy?
- What?

1008
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,820
Was there somebody in your room
when I called you?

1009
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,380
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I thought I heard a voice.

1010
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,360
I had the radio on.
I'm sorry, it was the television.

1011
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,620
Let's never break up again.
I don't want to be apart.

1012
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,180
I think we're both much too mature
for something like that.

1013
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,940
Living together hasn't been so bad,
has it?

1014
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,100
For me it's been terrific.
You know?

1015
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,620
Better than either of my marriages.

1016
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,860
There's something different about you.
I don't know what, but it's great.

1017
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:31,340
I think, if you let me,
I could help you have more fun.

1018
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,380
I know it's hard. Yeah.

1019
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,980
What if we go away this weekend?

1020
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,460
Why don't we get Rob, and the three
of us would drive into Brooklyn?

1021
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,060
We could show you the old neighborhood.
That'd be fun for you.

1022
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,200
Yeah, I'd love it.

1023
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,260
God, it's a great day!

1024
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,940
Watch the road!
You'll total the car!

1025
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,060
I've never been to Brooklyn.

1026
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,620
- I can't wait to see the neighborhood.
- The neighborhood will be great.

1027
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,780
- We could show her the schoolyard.
- I was a great athlete. Tell her.

1028
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,420
I was all-schoolyard.

1029
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,500
They threw him a football once.
He tried to dribble it.

1030
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,100
I used to lose
my glasses a lot.

1031
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,700
Look! That's my old house.
That's where I used to live.

1032
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,160
Holy cow!

1033
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,260
You're lucky. Where I used to live
is now a pornographic equipment store.

1034
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,460
I had some very
good memories there.

1035
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,500
What good memories, your mother
and father fighting all the time?

1036
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,080
And over the most ridiculous things.

1037
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,580
- You fired the cleaning woman?
- She was stealing!

1038
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,100
But she's colored.
The colored have enough trouble!

1039
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,580
- She was going through my purse.
- They're persecuted enough.

1040
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,500
- Who's persecuting? She stole!
- So? We can afford it.

1041
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,740
How can we afford it, on your pay?
What if she steals more?

1042
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,780
She's a colored woman from Harlem.
She has no money.

1043
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,620
She has a right to steal from us.
Who can she steal from if not from us?

1044
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,220
- You're both crazy.
- They can't hear you.

1045
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,920
Leo, I married a fool!

1046
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,700
Hey, Max! What's that?

1047
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,040
That's the welcome home party, 1945,
for my cousin Herbie.

1048
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,500
Look. That over there
is Joey Nichols.

1049
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,540
He was my father's friend. He was
always bothering me when I was a kid.

1050
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,420
Joey Nichols.
See? Nickels.

1051
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,660
See? Nickels.
You see? Nickels.

1052
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,580
You can always remember my name.
Just think of Joey Five-Cents.

1053
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,460
That's me.
Joey Five-Cents.

1054
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,060
What an asshole.

1055
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,300
The one who killed me the most
was my mother's sister, Tessie.

1056
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,940
I was always the sister
with good common sense...

1057
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,540
but Tessie was always the one
with personality.

1058
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,500
When she was younger,
they all wanted to marry Tessie.

1059
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,260
Do you believe Tessie
had the personality?

1060
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,020
- She's the life of the ghetto no doubt.
- She was once a great beauty.

1061
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,860
Tessie, they say you were the sister
with personality.

1062
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,420
I was a great beauty!

1063
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,380
- How did this personality come about?
- I was very charming.

1064
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,500
There were many men
interested in you?

1065
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,220
I was quite a lively dancer.

1066
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,200
It's very hard to believe.

1067
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:04,300
I had a really good day.
It was a fine way to spend my birthday.

1068
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,420
- Your birthday isn't until tomorrow.
- But it's real close.

1069
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,760
But no presents until midnight.

1070
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,620
Happy birthday.

1071
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,700
What is this? Is this a present?
Are you kidding?

1072
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,020
- No! Why don't you try it on?
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:24,820
- This is more like a present for you.
- It'll add ten years to our sex life.

1074
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,700
Yeah. Forget it.

1075
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,340
Here's a real present.

1076
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,320
- What is this anyway?
- Check it out.

1077
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,340
You knew I wanted this.
God, it's terrific!

1078
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,680
Just put on the watch and that thing.
It'll be perfect.

1079
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,740
Seems like

1080
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:02,280
Old times

1081
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,900
Having you

1082
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,580
To walk with

1083
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,680
Seems like

1084
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,160
Old times

1085
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,760
Having you to walk with

1086
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,300
And it's still a thrill

1087
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,420
Just to have my arms

1088
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,920
Around you

1089
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,860
Still the thrill

1090
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,740
That it was the day

1091
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,180
I found you

1092
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,660
Seems like

1093
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,040
Old times

1094
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,160
Dinner dates and flowers

1095
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:19,680
Old times

1096
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,220
Staying up all hours

1097
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,320
Making dreams come true

1098
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,280
Doing things we used

1099
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,680
To do

1100
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,940
Seems like

1101
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,520
Old times

1102
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,480
Here with

1103
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,640
You

1104
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,940
Thank you.

1105
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,140
You were sensational.

1106
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,460
I told you if you stuck to it,
you would be great and...

1107
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,580
You were sensational.

1108
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,860
Yeah, they were a terrific audience.

1109
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,380
It makes it easy for me,
because I can be...

1110
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,740
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Tony Lacey.

1111
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:36,420
- We wanted to say we enjoyed your set.
- Yeah? Really?

1112
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,340
I thought it was very musical.
I liked it a lot.

1113
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,460
That's really nice.
Thanks a lot.

1114
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,420
Are you recording?
Are you with any label?

1115
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,620
Me? No, not at all.

1116
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,740
I'd like to talk to you about that
sometime if you get a chance.

1117
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,620
Possibly working together.

1118
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,500
That's nice. This is Alvy Singer.
Do you know Alvy?

1119
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,620
I don't, but I know your work.
I'm a big fan of yours.

1120
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,720
This is Shawn, Bob and Petronia.

1121
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,060
We're going back to the Pierre...

1122
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,100
and we're going to meet
Jack and Angelica for a drink.

1123
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,180
If you'd like to come,
we'd love to have you.

1124
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,740
We can sit and talk.
Not a big deal.

1125
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,180
Just relax, be very mellow.

1126
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,340
Remember we had that thing?

1127
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,840
What thing?

1128
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,440
Remember we discussed that thing?

1129
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,860
Oh, the thing!
Oh, the thing. Yeah.

1130
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,020
Well, if it's inconvenient,
that's fine, too.

1131
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:49,540
We'll do it another time. If you're on
the coast, we'll get together there.

1132
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,100
It was a wonderful set.
I really enjoyed it.

1133
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,440
Nice to have met you.
Good night.

1134
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,060
What's the matter?
You want to go to that party?

1135
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,700
I don't know.
I thought it might be fun.

1136
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,880
It would be nice to meet
some new people.

1137
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,740
I don't think I could take a mellow
evening. I don't respond well to mellow.

1138
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,340
If I get too mellow,
I ripen and rot.

1139
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,620
- It's not good for my...
- All right.

1140
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,200
You don't want to go to the party.
What do you want to do?

1141
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,220
That day in Brooklyn was the last day
I remember having a good time.

1142
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,100
- We never have any laughs anymore.
- I've been moody and dissatisfied.

1143
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,100
- How often do you sleep together?
- Do you have sex often?

1144
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,420
Hardly ever.
Maybe three times a week.

1145
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,540
Constantly. I'd say three times a week.
Like the other night, Alvy wanted sex.

1146
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:49,540
She would not sleep with me
the other night.

1147
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,780
I don't know. Six months ago I would
have done it just to please him.

1148
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,700
I tried everything.

1149
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,140
I put on soft music
and my red light bulb.

1150
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,260
Since our discussions here, I feel
I have a right to my own feelings.

1151
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,580
I think you would have been happy,
because I really asserted myself.

1152
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,020
The incredible thing is,
I'm paying for her analysis...

1153
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,740
she's making progress,
and I'm getting screwed.

1154
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,980
I feel so guilty,
because Alvy is paying for it.

1155
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,260
So I feel guilty
if I don't sleep with him.

1156
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,020
But if I do sleep with him, it's like
I'm going against my own feelings.

1157
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,020
- I'm not making any progress.
- I can't win.

1158
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,200
Sometimes I think
I should live with a woman.

1159
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,380
I don't believe it.
You guys have never snorted coke?

1160
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,460
I always wanted to try,
but Alvy's very down on it.

1161
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:41,020
Don't put it on me. I don't want to put
a wad of white powder in my nose.

1162
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,940
There's the nasal membrane.

1163
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:46,460
- You never want to try anything new.
- How can you say that?

1164
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:51,140
I said you, I and that girl
from acting class should sleep together.

1165
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,020
- That's sick.
- I know it's sick, but it's new.

1166
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,720
- You didn't say it couldn't be sick.
- Come on, Alvy.

1167
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,340
- Do your body a favor. Try it.
- It'll be fun.

1168
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,580
I'm sure it's fun, 'cause the Incas
did it. They were a million laughs.

1169
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,940
For your own experience.
You want to write. Why not?

1170
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,860
It's great stuff, Alvy. A friend
just brought it in from California.

1171
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,060
I didn't tell you.
We're going to California next week.

1172
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,100
It's really a thrill, as you know.

1173
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,380
On my agent's advice, I sold out
and am going to do a TV appearance.

1174
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,820
That's not it at all.
Alvy's giving an award on TV.

1175
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,220
You act like you're violating
a moral issue.

1176
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,260
It's so phony. We have to leave New York
during Christmas. It kills me.

1177
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:35,700
Listen, while you're in California,
could you score some coke for me?

1178
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,660
Sure, be glad to. I'll just put it
in the hollow heel on my boot.

1179
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,060
- How much is this stuff?
- About $2,000 an ounce.

1180
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,600
Really?
And what is the kick of it?

1181
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,900
I've never been so relaxed
as I have been since I moved out here.

1182
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,780
I want you to see my house.
I live next to Hugh Hefner.

1183
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,860
And the women are like in Playboy,
but they can move their arms and legs.

1184
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:13,460
I can't get over that
this is really Beverly Hills.

1185
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,420
The architecture is really consistent.
There's French next to Spanish...

1186
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,940
next to Tudor next to Japanese.

1187
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,860
It's so clean out here.

1188
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,540
Because they don't throw garbage away.
They make it into TV shows.

1189
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,980
- Give us a break. It's Christmas.
- Can you believe this is Christmas?

1190
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:32,580
It was snowing and really gray
in New York.

1191
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,180
Nice. Santa Claus
will have sun stroke.

1192
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,420
Max, there's no crime,
there's no mugging.

1193
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,500
There's no economic crime...

1194
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,620
but there's ritual,
religious cult murders.

1195
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,620
There's wheat-germ
killers out here.

1196
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,220
While you're out here,
I want you to see my TV show.

1197
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,760
And we're invited
to a big Christmas party.

1198
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,760
Charlie, give me a good laugh here.

1199
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,500
A little bigger.

1200
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,100
Do you realize how immoral
this all is?

1201
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:14,220
I've got a hit series.

1202
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,240
But you're adding fake laughs.

1203
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,060
Give me a tremendous laugh here.

1204
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,140
We do the show live
in front of an audience.

1205
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,340
But nobody laughs,
because the jokes aren't funny.

1206
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,920
That's why this machine is dynamite.

1207
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,780
Give me a medium chuckle here...

1208
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,740
and then a big hand.

1209
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,540
Is there booing on that?

1210
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,220
I don't feel well.

1211
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,740
- What's the matter?
- I got very dizzy.

1212
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,020
- I feel dizzy.
- Sit down.

1213
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,520
Jesus.

1214
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,180
You all right?
You want to lie down?

1215
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,140
No. My stomach felt
queasy all morning.

1216
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,220
How about a ginger ale?

1217
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,900
No.
Maybe I'd better lie down.

1218
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,600
Try to get some of this down.
It's just plain chicken.

1219
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,040
No, I can't eat this.
I'm nauseous.

1220
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,780
If you could get me something
to get me through the next two hours.

1221
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,540
I have to go to Burbank
and give out an award on a TV show.

1222
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,180
There's nothing wrong with you
as far as I can tell.

1223
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,300
You have no fever,
no symptoms of anything serious.

1224
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:29,380
- You haven't eaten pork or shellfish.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry, Doctor.

1225
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,300
Alvy, that was the show. Everything
is fine. They found a replacement.

1226
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,420
They're going to tape without you.

1227
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,000
Jesus!
Now I don't get to do the TV show?

1228
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,260
- I can't find any reason for this.
- Nothing at all?

1229
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,180
- I could get a lab man up here.
- Hand me the salt, please.

1230
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,140
Perhaps it would be better
if we took him to the hospital.

1231
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,580
The hospital?

1232
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,880
- There's no other way to diagnose him.
- This is not bad, actually.

1233
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,020
Don't tell me we're going to have
to walk from the car to the house?

1234
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,980
My feet haven't touched pavement
since I reached Los Angeles.

1235
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:09,700
I'll take a meeting with you
if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.

1236
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,900
I took a meeting with Freddy.
Freddy took a meeting with Charlie.

1237
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,580
- You take a meeting with him.
- All the good meetings are taken.

1238
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,500
Right now it's only a notion.

1239
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,520
I think I can get money to make it into
a concept, then turn it into an idea.

1240
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,180
Like this house, Max?

1241
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,700
Even wrote a road map
to get us to the bathroom.

1242
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,740
You should have told me
it was Tony Lacey's party.

1243
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,460
What difference does that make?

1244
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,380
I think he has a thing for Annie.

1245
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,260
- No. He goes with that girl over there.
- Where?

1246
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,220
- The one with the VPL.
- VPL?

1247
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,180
Visible panty line.
She's gorgeous.

1248
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,340
She's a ten. That's great for you,
'cause you're used to two's, aren't you?

1249
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,940
There are no two's.

1250
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,540
You're used to the kind with shopping
bags walking through Central Park...

1251
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,140
with the surgical masks on,
muttering.

1252
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,940
How do you like this couple? They look
like they're from Masters and Johnson.

1253
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,820
Intensive care ward.
My God!

1254
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,760
- I think she's giving me the eye.
- If she comes over, my brain will mush.

1255
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,580
You're Alvy Singer, right?
Didn't we meet at EST?

1256
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,420
No, I was never to EST.

1257
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,460
- Then how can you criticize it?
- He didn't say anything.

1258
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,620
I came to get some shock therapy,
but there was an energy crisis.

1259
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,340
- He's my food taster. Have you two met?
- How do you do?

1260
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,380
- Do you taste for poisoned food?
- Yeah, he's great.

1261
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,780
You guys are wearing white.
It must be in the stars.

1262
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,580
- Uri Geller must be on the premises.
- We're going to operate together.

1263
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:31,420
In about six weeks
we could cut the whole album.

1264
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,820
I don't know.
This is strange to me.

1265
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,780
You can stay here.
Use the whole wing in this house.

1266
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,300
- Stay here?
- Really. Why are you smiling?

1267
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,700
Not only is he a great agent,
but he really gives good leading.

1268
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,060
This is a great house: Saunas,
Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.

1269
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:53,220
You know who the original owners were?
Nelson Eddy then Legs Diamond.

1270
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,500
- Then you know who lived here?
- Trigger.

1271
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,840
Charlie Chaplin,
right before his un-American thing.

1272
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,300
- But you guys are still New Yorkers.
- Yeah, I love it there.

1273
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,180
I used to live there for years,
but it's so dirty now.

1274
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,340
- I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
- This is a nice screening room.

1275
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,540
There's another thing about New York.

1276
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,660
If you want to see a movie,
you have to stand on line.

1277
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,020
It could be freezing or raining.
And here...

1278
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,460
We saw Grand Illusion here last night.

1279
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,380
That's a great film if you're high.
It's really funny.

1280
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,580
Come and see our bedroom.
We did a fantastic thing up there.

1281
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,660
I'm cool.

1282
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,580
It's wonderful.
They eat and watch movies all day.

1283
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,940
And gradually you get old and die. It's
important to make an effort sometimes.

1284
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,260
- Do you think his girlfriend's pretty?
- She's great looking.

1285
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,540
A little on the androgynous side.

1286
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,520
I forgot my mantra.

1287
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,580
That was fun.

1288
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,660
I don't think California
is bad at all.

1289
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,900
It's a drag coming home.

1290
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,900
A lot of beautiful women.
It was fun to flirt.

1291
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,020
I have to face facts.

1292
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:22,540
I adore Alvy, but our relationship
doesn't seem to work anymore.

1293
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,180
I'll have the usual trouble
with Annie in bed tonight.

1294
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,100
Why do I need this?

1295
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,900
If only I had the nerve to break up,
but it would really hurt him.

1296
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,380
If only I didn't feel guilty
asking Annie to move out.

1297
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,660
It'd probably wreck her,
but I should be honest.

1298
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,340
Alvy, let's face it.

1299
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,980
I don't think our relationship
is working.

1300
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,980
I know. A relationship
is like a shark:

1301
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,220
It has to constantly
move forward or it dies.

1302
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,060
And I think what we've got
on our hands is a dead shark.

1303
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,780
- Whose Catcher in the Rye is this?
- If it has my name on it...

1304
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,940
I guess it's mine.

1305
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,540
You wrote your name in all my books,
'cause you knew this day would come.

1306
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,940
You wanted to break up
just as much as I do.

1307
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,780
No question. I think
we're doing the mature thing.

1308
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,020
Look. All the books
on death and dying are yours.

1309
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,420
And all the poetry books are mine.

1310
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,780
Denial of Death.
This is the first book I got you.

1311
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,700
Remember that day?

1312
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,280
I feel like there's
a great weight off my back.

1313
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,780
Thanks, honey.

1314
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,980
I mean, no. I think it's important
for us to explore new relationships.

1315
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,940
There's no question about that, because
we've given this a more than fair shot.

1316
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,100
My analyst thinks this move
is key for me.

1317
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,380
And I trust her,
because my analyst recommended her.

1318
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,420
Why should I put you through
all my moods and hang-ups anyway?

1319
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,860
You know what the beauty part is?
We can always come back together again.

1320
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,020
- There's no problem.
- Exactly.

1321
01:16:56,120 --> 01:17:00,540
I don't think many couples could handle
this, break up and remain friends.

1322
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,180
This button is mine.
Remember?

1323
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,820
These are yours. "Impeach Eisenhower."
"Impeach Nixon."

1324
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,400
"Impeach Lyndon Johnson."
"Impeach Ronald Reagan."

1325
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,140
I miss Annie.
I made a terrible mistake.

1326
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:18,140
She's living in Los Angeles
with Tony Lacey.

1327
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:21,620
If she is, then the hell with her. If
she likes that lifestyle, let her stay.

1328
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,420
- He's a jerk for one thing.
- He graduated Harvard.

1329
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:28,280
Harvard makes mistakes, too.
Kissinger taught there.

1330
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,460
Don't tell me you're jealous?

1331
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,580
Yeah. Jealous? A little bit.
Like Medea.

1332
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,180
Can I show you something?
I found this in the apartment.

1333
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,820
Black soap. She used to wash her face
800 times a day with black soap.

1334
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,820
Don't ask me why.

1335
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,300
Why don't you go out with other women?

1336
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,500
I tried,
but it's very depressing.

1337
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,380
This always happens to me.
Quick! Get a broom!

1338
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,500
What are you making
such a big deal about?

1339
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,140
They're only lobsters.

1340
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,380
- You're adult. You can pick up lobsters.
- I'm not myself since I quit smoking.

1341
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,580
- When did you quit?
- Sixteen years ago.

1342
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,400
- What do you mean?
- Mean?

1343
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,360
You stopped smoking 16 years ago.
Is that what you said?

1344
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,340
I don't understand.

1345
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,960
Are you joking or what?

1346
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,860
Central Park's turning green.

1347
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,580
I saw that lunatic we used to see
with the pinwheel hat...

1348
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,980
and the roller-skates.

1349
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,340
Listen, I want you to come back here.

1350
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,720
Well, then I'm going to come out there
and get you.

1351
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,100
What do you mean, where am I?
Where do you think I am?

1352
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,180
I'm at the Los Angeles airport.
I flew in.

1353
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,980
I flew in to see you.

1354
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,140
Can we not debate this
on the telephone...

1355
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,900
because I've got a temperature...

1356
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,920
and I'm getting my chronic
Los Angeles nausea again.

1357
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,340
Wherever you want to meet.
I don't care.

1358
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:12,320
I'll drive in.
I rented a car.

1359
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,260
I'm driving.

1360
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,200
What, is that such a miracle?
I'm driving myself.

1361
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,540
I'm going to have the alfalfa sprouts...

1362
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,120
and a plate of mashed yeast.

1363
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,460
You look pretty.

1364
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,040
No, I just lost a little weight,
that's all.

1365
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,980
Well, you look nice.

1366
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,740
I think we should get married.

1367
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,240
Come on.

1368
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,260
Why, you want to live out here?
It's like living in Munchkinland.

1369
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,940
What do you mean?
It's perfectly fine out here.

1370
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:29,260
Tony's very nice.

1371
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,380
I meet people, go to parties
and play tennis.

1372
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,100
That's a very big step for me.

1373
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,180
I'm able to enjoy people more.

1374
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,140
You're not going to come back
to New York?

1375
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,940
What's so great about New York? It's a
dying city. You read Death in Venice.

1376
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:48,220
You didn't read Death in Venice
until I bought it for you.

1377
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,540
That's right. You only gave me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1378
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,860
Because it's an important issue.

1379
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:56,820
You're incapable of enjoying life.
You know that?

1380
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:59,220
You're like New York City.
You're just this person.

1381
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,780
You're like this island unto yourself.

1382
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,820
I can't enjoy anything
unless everybody is.

1383
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:09,120
If one guy is starving someplace,
it puts a crimp in my evening.

1384
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,280
Do you want to get married?

1385
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,300
No. We're friends.

1386
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,000
I want to remain friends.

1387
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,340
Check please.

1388
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,260
You're mad, aren't you?

1389
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,100
Yes, of course I'm mad,
because you love me. I know that.

1390
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,580
I can't say that that's true
at this point in my life.

1391
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,260
I really can't say that's true.

1392
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,140
You know how wonderful you are.

1393
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,900
You're the reason I got out of my room,
that I was able to sing...

1394
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,140
and get more in touch with my feelings
and all that crap.

1395
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,520
Listen, listen.

1396
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,400
So what are you up to?

1397
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:57,480
The usual. I'm trying to write.
I'm working on a play.

1398
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,720
Are you saying you're not coming back
to New York with me?

1399
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,540
No. Look.
I gotta go.

1400
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,820
What do you mean?
I flew 3,000 miles to see you.

1401
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,540
Air miles. Do you know
what that does to my stomach?

1402
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,540
If you must know,
it's a hectic time for Tony.

1403
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,500
- The Grammys are tonight.
- The what?

1404
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,620
The Grammys. He's got a lot
of records up for awards.

1405
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,300
They give awards for that music?
I thought just ear plugs.

1406
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,780
Just forget it. Let's just
forget the conversation.

1407
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,820
They do nothing but give out awards.
I can't believe it.

1408
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,960
Greatest Fascist Dictator:
Adolph Hitler.

1409
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,700
I know what you're going to say.
I'm not a great driver.

1410
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,780
- I have some problems with...
- May I see your license, please?

1411
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,340
Just don't get angry.

1412
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,160
I have my license here.
It's a rented car.

1413
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,220
Don't give me your life's story.

1414
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,460
Just pick up the license.

1415
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,220
You have to ask nicely, because
I've had a rough day. My girlfriend...

1416
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,720
Just give me the license, please.

1417
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,060
Since you put it that way,
it's hard for me to refuse.

1418
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,100
I have a terrific problem
with authority.

1419
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,480
It's not your fault.
Don't take it personal.

1420
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,840
So long, fellows.
Keep in touch.

1421
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,580
Imagine my surprise
when I got your call.

1422
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,780
Yeah. I had the feeling
I got you at a bad moment.

1423
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,020
I heard high-pitched squealing.

1424
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,560
Twins, Max.

1425
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,400
Sixteen-year-olds.

1426
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:14,380
Can you imagine the mathematical
possibilities of that?

1427
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,820
You're an actor. You should be doing
Shakespeare in the park.

1428
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,060
I did Shakespeare in the park.
I got mugged.

1429
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,440
I was playing Richard II. Two guys
with leather jackets stole my leotard.

1430
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,900
Are we driving through plutonium?

1431
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,320
Keeps out the alpha rays.
You don't get old.

1432
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,660
You're a thinking person.
How can you choose this lifestyle?

1433
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,380
What is so great about New York?

1434
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,500
It's a dying city.
You read Death in Venice.

1435
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,860
You didn't read Death in Venice
until I gave it to you.

1436
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,180
You only give me books
with the word "death" in the title.

1437
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,980
- It's an important issue.
- You're incapable of enjoying life.

1438
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,020
You're like New York.
You're an island.

1439
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,580
Okay. If that's all that we've been
through together means to you...

1440
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,140
it's better if we just said good-bye,
once and for all.

1441
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,700
It's funny.

1442
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,060
After all the serious talks
and passionate moments...

1443
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,560
that it ends here, in a health food
restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.

1444
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,540
Good-bye, Sally.

1445
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:20,860
Wait.
I'm going to go with you.

1446
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,880
I love you.

1447
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,860
What do you want?
It was my first play.

1448
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,900
You know how you're always trying to
get things to come out perfect in art...

1449
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,060
because it's real difficult in life.

1450
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:39,500
Interestingly, however,
I did run into Annie again.

1451
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,540
It was on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan.

1452
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:45,180
She had moved back to New York.
She was living in Soho with some guy.

1453
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,180
When I met her, she was dragging him
in to see The Sorrow and the Pity...

1454
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,740
which I counted
as a personal triumph.

1455
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,460
Annie and I had lunch
sometime after that...

1456
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,420
and just kicked around old times.

1457
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,480
Just to have my arms

1458
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,400
Around you

1459
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,280
Still the thrill

1460
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,980
That it was the day

1461
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,280
I found you

1462
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:23,280
Seems like

1463
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:30,000
Old times

1464
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,680
Dinner dates and flowers

1465
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,360
Old times

1466
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,460
After that, it got late
and we both had to go.

1467
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,620
But it was great seeing Annie again.

1468
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,300
I realize
what a terrific person she was...

1469
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,140
and how much fun it was
just knowing her.

1470
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,700
And I thought of that old joke.

1471
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,420
This guy goes to a psychiatrist
and says, "Doc, my brother's crazy.

1472
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,980
He thinks he's a chicken."

1473
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:07,260
The doctor says,
"Why don't you turn him in?"

1474
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,260
The guy says,
"I would, but I need the eggs."

1475
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,700
Well, I guess that's, now, how I feel
about relationships.

1476
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:19,580
They're totally irrational,
crazy and absurd.

1477
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,540
But I guess we keep going through it...

1478
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,720
because most of us need the eggs.

1479
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:26,840
THE END
